In the whispers of the forest deep,
Where ancient roots their secrets keep,
A flag unfurls, a tale untold,
In the heart of nature's stronghold.

Amidst the leaves that gently sway,
A symbol gleams in soft array,
Its hues a dance of light and shade,
A secret held within its glade.

For in the code of branches intertwined,
A hidden key, by fate designed,
To unlock the gate, to find the way,
To where the flag in splendor lay.

In the rhythm of the woodland's song,
The key resides, where shadows long,
Cast secrets on the forest floor,
A treasure waiting to explore.

So seek within the source's scroll,
Where whispers of the branches toll,
For there, in lines of script divine,
The path to flag, the key shall shine.

A symphony of nature's lore,
Where roots and branches intertwine,
A secret key, a flag unfurled,
In the enchanted depths of our world.
